									<h1>Joe Biden Become 46 President Of USA</h1>
									<p>Joe Biden held his wife Jill's hand as they strode up their new home's driveway Wednesday</br>
                                         which was the only normal thing about the day he became the president of the United States, reports AFP.</br>
                                          Washington was under unprecedented security lockdown, cheering crowds absent because of America's out-of-control Covid outbreak</br>
                                           and Donald Trump had only left the White House hours before.</br>
                                           Biden's armored black limousine had deposited him at the end of his new street </br>
                                            Pennsylvania Avenue  after his swearing in and a visit to Arlington National Cemetery to pay respects </br>
                                            to the US military war dead. But he popped the surreality of the moment with a quip as he made the short walk to</br>
                                            the White House with Jill, followed closely by Vice President Kamala Harris and her family. <b>"It feels like I'm going home,"</b></br>
                                             the president told an NBC News reporter, who was among the dozens of journalists recording each step from a grandstand.</br>
                                             The sound of military marching bands was still hanging in the air while a group of Secret Service agents in</br>
                                              long coats scanned the scene. Until shortly before his arrival, red dump trucks with <b>"God Bless America"</b> emblazoned </br>
                                              on their sides served as security barriers to Pennsylvania Avenue. It betrayed the overwhelming security machine for Biden's</br>
                                               extraordinary day, including miles of metal barriers, thousands of masked security forces and a dystopian-looking Washington that would 
                                               normally be primed to party on Inauguration Day</br>
                                               <b>"This looks like the entrance to a military base during war,"</b> said 42-year-old Joe Brunner from New York City,</br> 
                                               as he stood across from a checkpoint guarded by armed troops and military vehicles in central Washington. <b>"The atmosphere is very strange, it is very un-American",</b> </br>
                                               said 36-year-old Jason Sheffield, adding the security zone and heavy police presence <b>"is unethical to freedom" and "very scary."</b> Streets were nearly empty and many businesses</br>
                                                in downtown Washington were boarded up, some due to the pandemic and others because of recent violent protests
